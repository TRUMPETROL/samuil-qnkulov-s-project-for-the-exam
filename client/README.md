- the tutorial creation page will look like the tutorial browser page but with only a right side bar that will have a publish button in it ath the bottom(the left side will be removed to have more space for creating the project)
- abive the button there will be simple instructions as to how to use the tutorial creation menu.
-the get back to tutorial browser button will be at the very top of the page and will lead back to, well.... the TutorialBrowser.

-i will need a way to store all the tutorial a user has made(probably by using his user name which is already stored as information in the tutorial iteself)

- if a user has made at least one tutorial a new filter will apear in the left bar named (see your tutorials) with two options (yes) and (no)
-it will obviously filter only the tutorials made by you

-the user that created the tutorial will get additional options while checking it out(clicking the check out button) edit and delete

-edit and delete are self explanetory but delete will ask you like with the logout if you are shure you want to delete it and edit will just bring you back to a copy of the tutorial creation page tha will have a button named complete edit in the right bar intead of puslish as in the regular creation page.

-add actual error handling




//bonus

-in the home page add a section that will have all users listed with the number of tutorials they have made

-filter with options to filter the user by name, by specific text entered and by number of tutorials made will also be a nice addition
