-it will inlude tutorials and information about different elements of the process of making a 3d model for use in a video game.
-it will have a section with tutorials
-a possibility to upload tutorials(registered users only)
-the tutorials will be about stuff like topology, weightpainting, sculpting, animation etc.
-it will include a radio in which you can select either one of several premade songs or a user uploaded one(potentially even your own) to be played while browsing the site.
-a possibility to play user uploaded or upload music yourself will be available(registered users only)
-a possibility to play videos
-several presets for user made content:video+text,text+images,video+text+images.
-user made content will be able to have different tags such as a category of the tutorial (example: subdmodeling, basics etc) category of the programs used and the type of the tutorial(exaple,video,text+images)
-an about us section
-contacts section
-main community leads section(aka credits)
- a search bar with different categories to make searching for content easier.
